My concept is essentially a color memory game revolving around hitting the target. To create the game, the first modifications I made were changing the "map" color from black to white so that each square is visible, 
then to start the challenge of the game, I made it so that after only .5 seconds of having only the target colored in, each white square turns a random color, giving the player only half a second to spot which square is the target.
To increase the difficulty further, i made it so that the target square is also a random color on each level as well as the white squares turning a random color each time, this is so there is no memorization.
I also included a selection feature where now you have to click the enter key when you are on the target square, if you hit enter on the wrong square, then the "map" turns all black and you have to restart.
The final change had to do with the background css where I wanted to try to make it more distracting by using a color fade effect.
For the input, I was thinking of some sort of of psychical color selection or blending game where maybe each button represents a color or you have to link two buttons to match the blended color.
